  3D scanning is the process of analyzing a real-world object to collect data about its shape and possibly its appearance (e.g., color). The collected data is then used   to construct a digital 3D model. Most accurate 3D scanners are too expensive for enthusiasts and small businesses to acquire. Our project is a scanner head that can be   mounted to a CNC machine turning it into a 3D scanner to scan objects that can fit inside the CNC. We aim to design and build an accurate 3D scanner while keeping the   cost low. Working on a CNC platform removes the overhead of buying diffrent machines to model and build objects making for an overall cost effective solution.
