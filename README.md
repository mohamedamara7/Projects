  <p style="text-align: right "> 3D scanning is the process of analyzing a real-world object to collect data about its shape and possibly its appearance (e.g., color). The collected data is then used   to construct a digital 3D model. Most accurate 3D scanners are too expensive for enthusiasts and small businesses to acquire. Our project is a scanner head that can be   mounted to a CNC machine turning it into a 3D scanner to scan objects that can fit inside the CNC. We aim to design and build an accurate 3D scanner while keeping the   cost low. Working on a CNC platform removes the overhead of buying diffrent machines to model and build objects making for an overall cost effective solution. </p>

  <p>Technologies: Multimedia, Artificial Intelligence, Computer Networks</p>
  <p>Live is used to reduce the size of the live video, searches in the video by words and divides the video into sections. </p>

* <p>Videra</p>
  <p>Technologies: Distributed Computing, Computer Vision, Multimedia</p>
  <p style="text-align: right "> Videra is a tool to help streamline the deployment of computer vision
software aiming at making videos searchable while operating on large
volumes of data. Videra provides a distributed, highly available, fault
tolerant and reliable platform enabling application scalability at a low
development cost.
With Videra, companies can innovate new solutions enabling video
search capabilities, such as facial recognition, highlights extraction,
video montage; without worrying about deployment details or scalability
issues. </p>

* <p>Eagle Eye</p>
  <p>Technologies: Image Processing, Machine Learning, Geographic Information</p>
  <p style="text-align: right "> Eagle Eye is a project aimed at helping the government find illegal residential
buildings on agricultural lands. It automates the process of segmenting satellite
images into vector maps. This is done by applying machine learning algorithms
on a large amount of satellite data. Then, it checks the list of detected buildings
within agricultural land against a user-provided list of permits. </p>

* <p>Argus</p>
  <p>Technologies: Image processing, Computer vision, Machine learning.</p>
  <p style="text-align: right "> Argus detects road accidents and reports them almost in
real-time. It also detects traffic violations. </p>

* Breast Cancer (ML: 6 classification models - feature selection),(DL: Image).
  <p>Technologies: Machine Learning, Computer vision</p>
  
* <p>Ai generated image-video</p>
* 
* <p>Recommendation systems</p>
